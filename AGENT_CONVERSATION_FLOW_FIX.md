# Agent Conversation Flow Fix

## Issues Identified

After analyzing the agent logs and code, I identified several critical issues that were breaking the agent's conversation flow:

### 1. Tool Call Context Loss
- **Problem**: When using the Chutes LLM provider in JSON workaround mode (non-native tool calling), `ToolCall` messages in the conversation history were being completely skipped with warnings.
- **Impact**: The LLM couldn't see what tools had been called in previous turns, leading to repetitive behavior and "Initial" responses.

### 2. Tool Result Format Loss  
- **Problem**: `ToolFormattedResult` messages were being converted to generic text like "Tool result: {output}" without preserving the tool name or structure.
- **Impact**: The LLM couldn't understand which tool produced which results, breaking the chain of reasoning.

### 3. Sequential Thinking Tool Validation Errors
- **Problem**: The `sequential_thinking` tool had overly strict validation requiring minimum values of 1 for optional fields like `revisesThought` and `branchFromThought`.
- **Impact**: When the LLM provided these fields with value 0 (which is natural when not using them), the tool would fail with "Invalid tool input: 0 is less than the minimum of 1".

### 4. Conversation History Corruption
- **Problem**: The combination of skipped tool calls and poorly formatted results meant each LLM call received an incomplete/corrupted view of the conversation.
- **Impact**: The agent couldn't maintain context across turns, leading to infinite loops and inability to complete tasks.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Message Conversion (chutes_openai.py)
- **Tool Calls**: Now converted to descriptive assistant messages like "I'll use the {tool_name} tool with these parameters: {params}"
- **Tool Results**: Now formatted as "Tool result from {tool_name}:\n{output}" to preserve context
- **Benefit**: The LLM can now see the full conversation flow even without native tool calling

### 2. Sequential Thinking Tool Schema Fix (sequential_thinking_tool.py)
- **Schema**: Added conditional validation using `allOf` - `revisesThought` only required when `isRevision` is true
- **Validation**: Updated `_validate_thought_data` to treat 0/empty values as "not provided" rather than invalid
- **Instructions**: Added clear guidance to not include optional fields unless actually using them
- **Benefit**: The tool now accepts valid inputs without spurious validation errors

### 3. Improved Tool Instructions
- **Examples**: Added specific note for `sequential_thinking` to not include optional fields
- **Clarity**: Emphasized never setting optional fields to 0 or empty strings
- **Benefit**: Reduces likelihood of LLMs generating invalid tool calls

## Expected Improvements

1. **Proper Context Maintenance**: The agent will now see the complete conversation history including all tool calls and results.

2. **No More "Initial" Loops**: With proper context, the LLM won't repeatedly start from scratch with "Initial research" responses.

3. **Successful Tool Execution**: The `sequential_thinking` tool will work properly without validation errors.

4. **Task Completion**: The agent should now be able to complete multi-step tasks by building on previous tool results.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the same "fusion reactor research" task to verify:
   - No more validation errors
   - Proper progression through research steps
   - Successful task completion

2. Monitor for:
   - Proper tool call/result formatting in logs
   - Absence of "Skipping ToolCall message" warnings
   - Progressive rather than repetitive responses

3. Verify with other complex multi-step tasks that require tool chaining.

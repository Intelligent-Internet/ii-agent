#   - Supports: image generation, video generation, speech generation (single & multi-speaker)
# For Vertex AI: set the following environment variables
#   - Supports: image generation, video generation (requires GCS bucket)
#   - MEDIA_GCS_OUTPUT_BUCKET=gs://your_bucket_here (only needed for video generation with Vertex AI)

# Frontend App GAIA Page Directory Summary (`frontend/app/gaia/`)

This directory contains the page component for displaying information related to the GAIA (General AI Assistant) benchmark.

## File Descriptions:

*   **`page.tsx`**: This is a client-side React component (`"use client"`) that renders the `/gaia` route.
    *   **Current Functionality (Active Code)**:
        *   Displays a static informational page about the GAIA benchmark.
        *   Highlights the performance of the `ii-agent` (which powers fubea) on this benchmark.
        *   Includes sections such as "Standing on Shoulders of Giants," "About the GAIA Benchmark," and an image displaying benchmark scores (`benchmark_scores.png`).
        *   Provides a call to action with a link to the original benchmark results.
        *   Uses `framer-motion` for page animations and `lucide-react` for icons.
        *   Includes a back button to navigate to the home page.
    *   **Commented-Out Functionality**:
        *   The file contains a significant amount of commented-out code that suggests a previous or planned feature to allow users to *run* the GAIA benchmark directly from this page.
        *   This includes UI elements for configuration (selecting dataset, number of tasks), a button to trigger the benchmark, loading indicators, and sections to display detailed results.
        *   It also defines TypeScript interfaces for the expected API response structure (`GaiaResult`, `GaiaSummary`, `GaiaResponse`) and includes logic to call a backend API endpoint (`/api/gaia/run`) to execute the benchmark.

## Role of the Directory:

The `frontend/app/gaia/` directory, through its `page.tsx` file, serves to inform users about the GAIA benchmark and showcase the application's (or its underlying engine's) capabilities and performance. While currently a static page, it has the latent capability to become an interactive benchmark execution tool if the commented-out code is reactivated.

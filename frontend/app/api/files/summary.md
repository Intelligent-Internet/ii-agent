# Frontend App API Files Directory Summary (`frontend/app/api/files/`)

This directory is intended to house API route handlers related to file operations for the Next.js application.

## Contents:

As of the last scan, this directory does not contain any files. It likely serves as a placeholder for future API routes or may dynamically handle routes based on file names or further subdirectories if specific file-related endpoints are implemented (e.g., `upload`, `download`, `list`).

## Role of the Directory:

The `frontend/app/api/files/` directory is designated for API endpoints that manage file interactions, such as handling file uploads from the client, serving files for download, or listing available files.

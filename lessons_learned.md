- Suppressed noisy Uvicorn access logs for /sw.js by adding a custom logging.Filter to the 'uvicorn.access' logger.
- Fixed WebSocket disconnections caused by File API 404/500 errors: Frontend was sending incorrect '/var/data/' path prefixes to backend, but backend expects relative paths and constructs workspace paths internally.
- Implemented dynamic maintenance message display: Backend API reads `data/maintenance.txt`, frontend fetches and shows message in H1.

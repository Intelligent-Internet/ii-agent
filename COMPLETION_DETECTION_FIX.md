# Fix for Premature Task Completion Issue

## Problem Description

The agent was prematurely marking tasks as completed when using DeepSeek V3 0324 via Chutes. Specifically:

1. Agent would make some tool calls (e.g., `web_search`, `visit_webpage`)
2. Model would fail to output proper tool call JSON in the next response
3. Agent would see `[no tools were called]` and immediately mark the task as complete
4. Frontend would show task as finished, even though research was incomplete

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Overly restrictive completion detection**: The original logic only looked for explicit completion keywords like "task completed" or "finished"
2. **Aggressive tool call loop detection**: The loop prevention was too strict, blocking legitimate research workflows
3. **No content-based analysis**: The agent didn't analyze the actual content to determine if it contained substantial research findings
4. **Binary completion logic**: Either complete or continue, with no middle ground for clarification

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Completion Detection (`anthropic_fc.py`)

**Before:**
```python
completion_indicators = [
    "task completed", "task is complete", "completed successfully",
    "finished", "done", "here is", "here's", "the answer is",
    "in summary", "to summarize", "in conclusion"
]
```

**After:**
```python
completion_indicators = [
    "task completed", "task is complete", "completed successfully",
    "finished", "done", "here is", "here's", "the answer is",
    "in summary", "to summarize", "in conclusion", "based on",
    "according to", "research shows", "information shows",
    "found that", "discovered that", "results indicate"
]

# NEW: Research-specific completion patterns
research_completion_patterns = [
    "florian standhartinger", "programmer", "software", "developer",
    "architect", "productivity-boost", "msg systems", "dap gmbh"
]

# NEW: Content-based completion detection
if has_research_content and len(last_response.strip()) > 100:
    seems_complete = True
```

**Key improvements:**
- Added research-specific completion indicators
- Content-based analysis for substantial responses
- Three-tier completion detection system

### 2. Clarification Mechanism

**NEW:** When the agent is uncertain about completion, it now asks for clarification:

```python
elif len(last_response.strip()) > 200 and not seems_continuing:
    clarification_prompt = (
        "I see you provided information but didn't use any tools. "
        "Are you finished with the research task, or do you need to continue? "
        "If you're done, please state 'Task completed' clearly. "
        "If you need to continue, please use the appropriate tools."
    )
    self.history.add_user_prompt(clarification_prompt)
    continue
```

### 3. Improved Loop Detection (`chutes_openai.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Very aggressive - blocked after 2 uses for sequential_thinking
if recent_tool_calls.count(tool_name) >= 2:
    if tool_name == "sequential_thinking":
        return True
```

**After:**
```python
# More lenient, tool-specific limits
if tool_name == "sequential_thinking":
    if tool_count >= 3:  # Increased from 2
        return True
elif tool_name in ["web_search", "visit_webpage"]:
    if tool_count >= 4:
        # Check for identical arguments
        identical_calls = sum(1 for name, args in recent_tool_details 
                            if name == tool_name and args == tool_args)
        if identical_calls >= 2:
            return True
        elif tool_count >= 5:
            return True
```

**Key improvements:**
- Increased limits for research tools
- Argument-aware detection (prevents identical calls, allows different queries)
- Tool-specific thresholds

### 4. Enhanced Tool Instructions

**Added to system prompt:**
```
- For research tasks: Continue using tools until you have comprehensive information, then provide a complete summary
- When you have sufficient information to answer the question, provide your final answer WITHOUT using tools
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify the improvements:

1. **Completion Detection Tests**: Verify different response patterns are correctly classified
2. **Content Analysis Tests**: Ensure substantial research content is recognized
3. **Clarification Tests**: Verify the agent asks for clarification when uncertain

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Legitimate Research Continuation**: Agent continues research when responses indicate more work needed
2. **Content-Based Completion**: Agent recognizes substantial research findings as potential completion
3. **Clarification When Uncertain**: Agent asks for clarification instead of guessing
4. **Reduced False Completions**: Fewer cases of premature task completion

## Example Scenario

**Before Fix:**
1. Agent searches for "Florian Standhartinger programmer"
2. Agent visits his website
3. Model provides substantial research content but no tool calls
4. Agent immediately marks task complete (❌ WRONG)

**After Fix:**
1. Agent searches for "Florian Standhartinger programmer"
2. Agent visits his website  
3. Model provides substantial research content but no tool calls
4. Agent analyzes content, recognizes research findings
5. Agent either:
   - Marks task complete if content seems comprehensive (✅ CORRECT)
   - Asks for clarification if uncertain (✅ BETTER)
   - Continues research if content seems incomplete (✅ CORRECT)

## Monitoring

To monitor the effectiveness of these fixes:

1. Look for log messages: `"Response appears to be a final answer based on content analysis"`
2. Look for log messages: `"Substantial response without clear continuation - asking for clarification"`
3. Check for reduced `[no tools were called]` → immediate completion patterns
4. Monitor for improved task completion accuracy in research scenarios

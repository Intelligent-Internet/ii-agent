# Frontend App API Directory Summary (`frontend/app/api/`)

This directory serves as a container for various API route handlers within the Next.js application, following the App Router convention where subdirectories often map to API endpoints.

## Contents:

This directory does not contain individual files directly. Instead, it organizes API-related logic into the following subdirectories:

*   **`files/`**: Likely contains API routes related to file operations (e.g., uploads, downloads, listings).
*   **`generate-summary/`**: Suggests API routes for generating summaries, possibly of text or documents.
*   **`maintenance_message/`**: Implies API routes for fetching or managing maintenance mode messages for the application.
*   **`transcribe/`**: Indicates API routes related to audio or video transcription services.

## Role of the Directory:

The `frontend/app/api/` directory is the central location for defining server-side API endpoints that the frontend application can interact with. Each subdirectory typically corresponds to a distinct set of API functionalities.

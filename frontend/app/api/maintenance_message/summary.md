# Frontend App API Maintenance Message Directory Summary (`frontend/app/api/maintenance_message/`)

This directory is intended to house API route handlers related to fetching or managing maintenance messages for the Next.js application.

## Contents:

As of the last scan, this directory does not contain any files. It likely serves as a placeholder for future API routes. If implemented, these routes would allow the application to display maintenance notifications to users, potentially fetched from a backend or configuration.

## Role of the Directory:

The `frontend/app/api/maintenance_message/` directory is designated for API endpoints that provide information about the application's maintenance status or deliver maintenance-related messages.

# File Edit Tool Implementation

This document describes the complete implementation of the `file_edit_tool.py` based on the TypeScript `FileEditTool.tsx`.

## Overview

The File Edit Tool provides precise string replacement functionality for files with robust validation, encoding detection, and timestamp tracking to ensure safe file operations.

## Features

âœ… **Exact String Replacement**: Performs targeted find-and-replace operations  
âœ… **File Creation**: Can create new files when `old_string` is empty  
âœ… **Encoding Detection**: Automatically detects file encoding using charset-normalizer/chardet  
âœ… **Line Ending Preservation**: Maintains original file line endings (CRLF/LF/CR)  
âœ… **Read Timestamp Tracking**: Prevents editing files that haven't been read first  
âœ… **Modification Detection**: Detects if files were modified since last read  
âœ… **Multiple Match Safety**: Requires explicit `replace_all=True` for multiple replacements  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with specific error types  
âœ… **Jupyter Notebook Protection**: Redirects notebook edits to NotebookEdit tool  

## Implementation Files

### Core Files

1. **`src/tools/file_system/file_edit_tool.py`** - Main file edit tool implementation
2. **`src/tools/file_system/file_read_tool.py`** - Updated file read tool with timestamp tracking
3. **`src/tools/file_system/shared_state.py`** - Shared timestamp tracking between tools

### Key Components

#### FileEditTool Class
- `run_impl()` - Main execution method with comprehensive validation
- Input validation and path normalization
- File existence and modification time checking
- String replacement with safety checks
- Encoding and line ending preservation

#### Utility Functions
- `detect_file_encoding()` - Multi-fallback encoding detection
- `detect_line_endings()` - Detects CRLF/LF/CR line endings
- `normalize_line_endings()` - Preserves original line ending style
- `get_file_snippet()` - Generates context snippets for results

#### FileTimestampTracker
- Thread-safe timestamp tracking across tool instances
- Prevents editing files that haven't been read
- Detects file modifications since last read

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_file_edit_tool.py
```

The test covers:
- âœ… File creation
- âœ… File reading and timestamp tracking  
- âœ… Single replacement editing
- âœ… Read-requirement validation
- âœ… Replace-all functionality
- âœ… Content verification

All tests pass successfully! ðŸŽ‰

## Dependencies

### Required
- `pydantic` - Type validation and field descriptions
- Standard library: `os`, `pathlib`, `threading`

### Optional (for better encoding detection)
- `charset-normalizer` - Recommended encoding detector
- `chardet` - Fallback encoding detector

The tool gracefully falls back to common encodings if these libraries aren't available.

This implementation provides a robust, safe, and feature-complete file editing tool that matches the functionality and safety guarantees of the original TypeScript version.

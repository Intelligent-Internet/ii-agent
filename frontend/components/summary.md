# Frontend Components Directory Summary (`frontend/components/`)

This directory contains a variety of reusable React components that form the building blocks of the fubea frontend application.

## File Descriptions:

*   **`action.tsx`**: Renders a visual representation of an individual AI agent action step (e.g., thinking, searching, executing a command). It displays an icon, title, and relevant value for each action, and can include a copy button for the latest action.
*   **`browser.tsx`**: Simulates a browser window to display web content, primarily screenshots (as base64 images) or raw HTML/Markdown content. It includes a mock browser frame with an address bar and an "open in new tab" button.
*   **`chat-message.tsx`**: A core component that renders the entire chat interface. It displays a list of messages (user and agent), handles file attachments (showing image previews or file icons), renders agent action steps using the `Action` component, shows loading/completion indicators, and integrates the `QuestionInput` component for user queries. It also includes features like copying messages and downloading long messages as PDFs.
*   **`code-editor.tsx`**: Implements a code editor interface with an integrated file explorer, using the Monaco Editor. It allows users to browse a file tree (fetched from an API), view file content with syntax highlighting, and download files or folders (as ZIP).
*   **`consent-dialog.tsx`**: Displays a modal dialog to obtain user consent for the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, with a particular emphasis on third-party data processing. It also exports utility functions for managing consent status using cookies.
*   **`cookie-banner.tsx`**: Renders a banner at the bottom of the page to inform users about the use of essential cookies and provides a button to accept/dismiss the banner. Dismissal status is stored in a cookie.
*   **`examples.tsx`**: Displays a selection of example prompts (randomly chosen from a predefined list) to help users get started. It can parse special suffixes in examples like "(Deep Research)" or "(file: <url>)" to pass relevant flags/data to a click handler.
*   **`home.tsx`**: A large, central orchestrator component for the main application UI. It manages overall application state (UI, chat, WebSocket, session) through various custom hooks. It dynamically renders different views based on whether a chat session is active (initial welcome screen vs. chat interface with tool panels). It integrates most other components to build the complete user experience.
*   **`image-browser.tsx`**: Similar to `browser.tsx`, but specifically designed to display a single image within a browser-like frame, often used for images generated by the AI.
*   **`install-prompt.tsx`**: Handles the logic and UI for prompting users to install the application as a Progressive Web App (PWA), listening for `beforeinstallprompt` and `appinstalled` events.
*   **`markdown.tsx`**: A wrapper around `react-markdown` for rendering Markdown strings as HTML. It includes various remark and rehype plugins for extended syntax support (GFM, math, raw HTML, syntax highlighting) and custom rendering for certain HTML elements.
*   **`model-picker.tsx`**: Provides a dropdown select UI for users to choose an AI model. It lists available models, indicates premium ones, and handles Pro access logic (e.g., auto-switching Pro users to a premium model or redirecting non-Pro users who try to select one).
*   **`model-selector.tsx`**: An informational component (not a picker) that displays how models are automatically selected based on task type (text vs. vision), listing primary models for each category.
*   **`pro-upgrade-button.tsx`**: A simple button component that, when clicked, navigates the user to the `/pro-upgrade` page.
*   **`pwa-handler.tsx`**: A non-visual component responsible for PWA functionalities, specifically registering the service worker (`/sw.js`) and handling service worker updates (notifying the user when a new version is available).
*   **`question-input.tsx`**: A rich input component for users to type questions or tasks. It supports auto-resizing, file uploads (with previews), a "Deep Research" toggle, audio input via microphone (with transcription), and a submit/stop button.
*   **`search-browser.tsx`**: Displays web search results within a browser-like frame, showing the search keyword and a list of result items (title, snippet, URL).
*   **`sidebar-button.tsx`**: Implements a button that toggles a sidebar. The sidebar fetches and lists past user sessions, allowing users to click to reload and view a previous session.
*   **`terminal.tsx`**: Provides an interactive terminal interface using XTerm.js. It allows users to input commands, see output, and supports command history. Parent components can also write output to it.
*   **`theme-provider.tsx`**: A wrapper around `next-themes`' `ThemeProvider` to enable theme management (e.g., light/dark mode) in the application.
*   **`upgrade-prompt.tsx`**: Displays a contextual prompt encouraging users to upgrade to "PRO Mode." The message and appearance vary based on the `type` prop (success, error, timeout of a previous task).
*   **`website-viewer.tsx`**: Displays a live website within an iframe, typically used to show websites deployed or generated by the AI agent. It includes an "Open in New Tab" button.

## Role of the Directory:

The `frontend/components/` directory is crucial for modularizing the UI and encapsulating specific functionalities. These components are combined in various ways, primarily within `home.tsx`, to create the rich, interactive frontend of the fubea application.
